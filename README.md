The Sudoku Solver project uses Python and data structures like 2D arrays, stacks,
lists, dictionaries, and tuples, providing the user with the ultimate Sudoku
experience. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve this puzzle at two
complexity levels - beginner and expert. Users can fine-tune the puzzles while
still being inside Sudoku, exploring new options of Sudoku variations, which
include Hyper Sudoku, Greater-Than Sudoku, and X-Sudoku. Interactivity has
also been brought about with the addition of interactive quizzes and step-by-step
solving guides to enhance the learning experience, which breeds logical thinking
and solving skills. Lastly, this project not only manifests technical prowess but
also serves for an exciting and challenging game of Sudoku.
